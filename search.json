    "text": "Undergraduate\nIf I am your undergraduate advisor, email and office hours are the most straightforward ways to discuss your questions.\n\n\nGraduate\nI am not currently soliciting applications, however any graduate student interested in collaborating is welcome to send me a proposal. It does not have to be particularly formal, however:\n\nTell me what questions you are interested in answering\nShow me what other work has been done in this avenue\nDiscuss a plan for executing your project\n\nI am fond of the Heilmeier Catechism, although it is not a perfect match for many kinds of academic research questions."

    "text": "Assistant Professor of Practice Department of Computer Science George Washington University\n\nI joined the GWU Department of Computer Science as a Visiting Professor in August 2022, and as an Assistant Professor of Practice in August 2023. You might read more about teaching and writing I have done.\nBefore this, I completed my PhD in Decision & Risk Analysis under the guidance of Elisabeth Paté-Cornell at Stanford University in California.\nSome years ago, I served on active duty in the U.S. Navy as a nuclear submarine line officer, and worked at the DOD Strategic Capabilities Office. I completed a B.S. (with honors) in Physics at the College of William and Mary in 2009.\nI am interested in improving the decisions that humans make. What that means is determined by each human.\nAdjacent to the university, I make acoustic, electric, and electronic music."

My notes are typically short, direct, and polite; I encourage you to write to me in this way.\nLately there is a trend towards long formal notes, perhaps generated with some algorithm. This style makes it harder for me to find your message amidst all the words.\nPlease refrain from sending me sales/marketing materials, I will mark these as spam."
