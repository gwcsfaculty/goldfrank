    "text": "This assignment is individual effort; adhere to the syllabus collaboration policy and ask me if you have any questions.\n\nGhostbusters\nNow, Pacman will hunt the ghosts. There is one caveat: the ghosts are invisible, and Pacman can only listen. Your sensor is a noisy reading of Manhattan distance to each ghost. To succeed, hunt and eat all ghosts on the map.\nDownload the starter code in tracking dot zip and try the game yourself:\npython busters.py\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe blocks of color indicate where the each ghost could possibly be, given the noisy distance readings provided to Pacman. The noisy distances at the bottom of the display are always non-negative, and always within 7 of the true distance. The probability of a distance reading decreases exponentially with its difference from the true distance.\n\n\n\nYour primary task in this project is to implement inference to track the ghosts. For the keyboard-based game above, a crude form of inference was implemented for you by default: all squares in which a ghost could possibly be are shaded by the color of the ghost.\nThroughout the rest of this project, you will implement algorithms for performing both exact and approximate inference using Bayes Nets.\nYou will edit bustersAgents.py, inference.py, and factorOperations.py. When complete, submit a single uncompressed tar of these files to the submit server. This assignment will not be graded immediately by the server, but I will run the same test cases that you have: if you complete the assignment according to the instructions, the grade you get from autograding locally is the grade you’ll get on the assignment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAutograder Details\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile watching and debugging your code with the autograder, it will be helpful to have some understanding of what the autograder is doing. There are 2 types of tests in this project, as differentiated by their .test files found in the subdirectories of the test_cases folder. For tests of class DoubleInferenceAgentTest, you will see visualizations of the inference distributions generated by your code, but all Pacman actions will be pre-selected according to the actions of the staff implementation. This is necessary to allow comparision of your distributions with the staff’s distributions. The second type of test is GameScoreTest, in which your BustersAgent will actually select actions for Pacman and you will watch your Pacman play and win games.\nFor this project, it is possible sometimes for the autograder to time out if running the tests with graphics. To accurately determine whether or not your code is efficient enough, you should run the tests with the --no-graphics flag. If the autograder passes with this flag, then you will receive full points, even if the autograder times out with graphics.\n\n\n\n\nProvided Code: Bayesian Networks\nFirst, take a look at bayesNet.py to see the classes you’ll be working with – BayesNet and Factor. You can also run this file to see an example BayesNet and associated Factors: python bayesNet.py.\nYou should look at the printStarterBayesNet function – there are helpful comments that can make your life much easier later on.\nThe Bayes Net created in this function is shown below:\n\n\n\n\n\nA summary of the terminology is given below:\n\nBayes Net: This is a representation of a probabilistic model as a directed acyclic graph and a set of conditional probability tables, one for each variable, as shown in lecture. The Traffic Bayes Net above is an example.\nFactor: This stores a table of probabilities, although the sum of the entries in the table is not necessarily 1.\n\nA factor is of the general form $f(X_1,…,X_m,y_1,…,y_n ∣ Z_1,…,Z_p,w_1,…,w_q) $.\nLower case variables have already been assigned.\nFor each possible assignment of values to the \\(X_i​\\) and \\(Z_j\\)​ variables, the factor stores a single number.\nThe \\(Z_j\\)​ and \\(w_k\\)​ variables are conditioned while the \\(X_i\\)​ and \\(y_l\\)​ variables are unconditioned.\n\nConditional Probability Table (CPT): This is a factor satisfying two properties:\n\nIts entries must sum to 1 for each assignment of the conditional variables.\nThere is exactly one unconditioned variable.\nThe Traffic Bayes Net stores the following CPTs:\n\n\\(P(Raining)\\)\n\\(P(Ballgame)\\)\n\\(P(Traffic | Ballgame, Raining)\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQ1 (2 pts) BayesNet Structure\nImplement the constructBayesNet function in inference.py.\nIt constructs an empty Bayes Net with the structure described below.1\n1 A Bayes Net is incomplete without the actual probabilities, but factors are defined and assigned by starter code separately; you don’t need to worry about it. If you are curious, you can take a look at an example of how it works in printStarterBayesNet in bayesNet.py. Reading this function can also be helpful for doing this question.The simplified ghost hunting world is generated according to the following Bayes net:\n\n\n\n\n\nDon’t worry if this looks complicated! We’ll take it step by step. As described in the code for constructBayesNet, we build the empty structure by listing all of the variables, their values, and the edges between them. This figure shows the variables and the edges, but what about their domains?\n\nAdd variables and edges based on the diagram.\nPacman and the two ghosts can be anywhere in the grid (we ignore walls for this).\n\nAdd all possible position tuples for these.\n\nObservations here are non-negative, equal to Manhattan distances of Pacman to ghosts \\(\\pm\\) noise.\n\nTo test and debug your code, run\npython autograder.py -q q1\n\n\nQ2 (3 pts) Join Factors\nImplement the joinFactors function in factorOperations.py. It takes in a list of Factors and returns a new Factor whose probability entries are the product of the corresponding rows of the input Factors.\njoinFactors can be used as the product rule/law of total probability:\n\nFor example, if we have a factor of the form \\(P(X∣Y)\\) and another factor of the form \\(P(Y)\\), then joining these factors will yield \\(P(X,Y)\\).\njoinFactors allows us to incorporate probabilities for conditioned variables (in this case, \\(Y\\)).\nHowever, you should not assume that joinFactors is called on probability tables.\n\nIt is possible to call joinFactors on Factors whose rows do not sum to 1.\n\n\nGrading: To test and debug your code, run\npython autograder.py -q q2\nIt may be useful to run specific tests during debugging, to see only one set of factors print out. For example, to only run the first test, run:\npython autograder.py -t test_cases/q2/1-product-rule\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHints\n\n\n\n\n\nYour joinFactors function should return a new Factor.\nHere are some examples of what joinFactors can do:\n\n\\(\\texttt{joinFactors}(P(X∣Y),P(Y)) \\rightarrow P(X,Y)\\)\n\\(\\texttt{joinFactors}(P(V,W∣X,Y,Z),P(X,Y∣Z)) \\rightarrow P(V,W,X,Y∣Z)\\)\n\\(\\texttt{joinFactors}(P(X∣Y,Z),P(Y))=P(X,Y∣Z)\\)\n\\(\\texttt{joinFactors}(P(V∣W),P(X∣Y),P(Z))=P(V,X,Z∣W,Y)\\)\n\nFor a general joinFactors operation, which variables are unconditioned in the returned Factor? Which variables are conditioned?\n\nFactor objects store a variableDomainsDict, which maps each variable to a list of values that it can take on (its domain).\nA Factor gets its variableDomainsDict from the BayesNet from which it was instantiated.\nAs a result, it contains all the variables of the BayesNet, not only the unconditioned and conditioned variables used in the Factor.\nFor this problem, you may assume that all the input Factor objets have come from the same BayesNet, and so their variableDomainsDicts are all the same.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQ3 (3 pts) Eliminate Factors\nImplement the eliminate function in factorOperations.py.\n\nIt takes a Factor and a variable to eliminate and returns a new Factor that does not contain that variable.\nThis corresponds to summing all of the entries in the Factor which only differ in the value of the variable being eliminated.\n\nGrading: To test and debug your code, run\npython autograder.py -q q3\nIt may be useful to run specific tests during debugging, to see only one set of factors print out. For example, to only run the first test, run:\npython autograder.py -t test_cases/q3/1-simple-eliminate\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHints\n\n\n\n\n\nYour eliminate should return a new Factor.\neliminate can be used to marginalize variables from probability tables. For example:\n\n\\(\\texttt{eliminate}(P(X,Y∣Z),Y)=P(X∣Z)\\)\n\\(\\texttt{eliminate}(P(X,Y∣Z),X)=P(Y∣Z)\\)\n\nFor a general eliminate operation, which variables are unconditioned in the returned Factor? Which variables are conditioned?\nRemember that Factors store the variableDomainsDict of the original BayesNet, and not only the unconditioned and conditioned variables that they use. As a result, the returned Factor should have the same variableDomainsDict as the input Factor.\n\n\n\n\n\nQ4 (2 pts) Variable Elimination\nImplement the inferenceByVariableElimination function in inference.py. It answers a probabilistic query, which is represented using a BayesNet, a list of query variables, and the evidence.\nGrading: To test and debug your code, run\npython autograder.py -q q4\nIt may be useful to run specific tests during debugging, to see only one set of factors print out. For example, to only run the first test, run:\npython autograder.py -t test_cases/q4/1-disconnected-eliminate\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHints\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe algorithm should iterate over hidden variables in elimination order, performing joining over and eliminating that variable, until the only the query and evidence variables remain.\nThe sum of the probabilities in your output factor should sum to 1 (so that it is a true conditional probability, conditioned on the evidence).\nLook at the inferenceByEnumeration function in inference.py for an example on how to use the desired functions.\nReminder: Inference by enumeration first joins over all the variables and then eliminates all the hidden variables.\n\nIn contrast, variable elimination interleaves join and eliminate by iterating over all the hidden variables and perform a join and eliminate on a single hidden variable before moving on to the next hidden variable.\n\n\nYou will need to take care of the special case where a factor you have joined only has one unconditioned variable (the docstring specifies what to do in greater detail).\n\n\n\n\n\nQ5 (1 pt)\nUnfortunately, having time steps will grow our graph far too much for variable elimination to be viable. Instead, we will use the Forward Algorithm for HMM’s for exact inference, and Particle Filtering for even faster but approximate inference.\nFor the rest of the project, we will be using the DiscreteDistribution class defined in inference.py to model belief distributions and weight distributions.\n\nThis class is an extension of the built-in Python dictionary class, where the keys are the different discrete elements of our distribution, and the corresponding values are proportional to the belief or weight that the distribution assigns that element.\nThis question asks you to fill in the missing parts of this class, which will be crucial for later questions (even though this question itself is worth no points).\n\n\nFill in the normalize method, which normalizes the values in the distribution to sum to one, but keeps the proportions of the values the same. Use the total method to find the sum of the values in the distribution. For an empty distribution or a distribution where all of the values are zero, do nothing. Note that this method modifies the distribution directly, rather than returning a new distribution.\nFill in the sample method, which draws a sample from the distribution, where the probability that a key is sampled is proportional to its corresponding value. Assume that the distribution is not empty, and not all of the values are zero. Note that the distribution does not necessarily have to be normalized prior to calling this method. You may find Python’s built-in random.random() function useful for this question.\nImplement the getObservationProb method in the InferenceModule base class in inference.py.\n\nThis method takes in an observation (which is a noisy reading of the distance to the ghost), Pacman’s position, the ghost’s position, and the position of the ghost’s jail.\nThe method returns the probability of the noisy distance reading given Pacman’s position and the ghost’s position. In other words, we want to return \\(P(noisyDistance∣pacmanPosition, ghostPosition)\\).\nThe distance sensor has a probability distribution over distance readings given the true distance from Pacman to the ghost. This distribution is modeled by the function busters.getObservationProbability(noisyDistance, trueDistance), which returns \\(P(noisyDistance∣trueDistance)\\) and is provided for you. You should use this function to help you solve the problem, and use the provided manhattanDistance function to find the distance between Pacman’s location and the ghost’s location.\nThere is the special case of jail that we have to handle as well. Specifically, when we capture a ghost and send it to the jail location, our distance sensor deterministically returns None, and nothing else (observation = None if and only if ghost is in jail). One consequence of this is that if the ghost’s position is the jail position, then the observation is None with probability 1, and everything else with probability 0. Make sure you handle this special case in your implementation; we effectively have a different set of rules for whenever ghost is in jail, as well as whenever observation is None.\n\n\nTo test your code and run the autograder for this question:\npython autograder.py -q q5\n\n\nQ6 (2 pts) Exact Inference Observation\nIn this question, you will implement the observeUpdate method in the ExactInference class of inference.py to correctly update the agent’s belief distribution over ghost positions given an observation from Pacman’s sensors. You are implementing the online belief update for observing new evidence.\n\nThe observeUpdate method should, for this problem, update the belief at every position on the map after receiving a sensor reading.\nYou should iterate your updates over the variable self.allPositions which includes all legal positions plus the special jail position.\nBeliefs represent the probability that the ghost is at a particular location, and are stored as a DiscreteDistribution object in a field called self.beliefs, which you should update.\n\nBe sure you know what inference problem you are trying to solve. You should use the function self.getObservationProb that you wrote in the last question, which returns the probability of an observation given Pacman’s position, a potential ghost position, and the jail position.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTips\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can obtain Pacman’s position using gameState.getPacmanPosition(), and the jail position using self.getJailPosition().\nIn the Pacman display, high posterior beliefs are represented by bright colors, while low beliefs are represented by dim colors. You should start with a large cloud of belief that shrinks over time as more evidence accumulates. As you watch the test cases, be sure that you understand how the squares converge to their final coloring.\nYour busters agents have a separate inference module for each ghost they are tracking. That’s why if you print an observation inside the observeUpdate function, you’ll only see a single number even though there may be multiple ghosts on the board.\n\n\n\n\nTo run the autograder for this question and visualize the output:\npython autograder.py -q q6\nIf you want to run this test (or any of the other tests) without graphics you can add the following flag:\npython autograder.py -q q6 --no-graphics\n\n\nQ7 (2 pts) Exact Inference with Time Elapse\nIn the previous question you implemented belief updates for Pacman based on his observations. Pacman’s observations are not his only source of knowledge about where a ghost may be. Pacman also has knowledge about the ways that a ghost may move; namely that the ghost can not move through a wall or more than one space in one time step. You have a model for the Ghost’s behavior.\nTo understand why this is useful to Pacman, consider the following scenario in which there is Pacman and one Ghost. Pacman receives many observations which indicate the ghost is very near, but then one which indicates the ghost is very far. The reading indicating the ghost is very far is likely to be the result of a buggy sensor. Pacman’s prior knowledge of how the ghost may move will decrease the impact of this reading since Pacman knows the ghost could not move so far in only one move.\nIn this question, you will implement the elapseTime method in ExactInference. The elapseTime step should, for this problem, update the belief at every position on the map after one time step elapsing. Your agent has access to the action distribution for the ghost through self.getPositionDistribution. In order to obtain the distribution over new positions for the ghost, given its previous position, use this line of code:\nnewPosDist = self.getPositionDistribution(gameState, oldPos)\nWhere oldPos refers to the previous ghost position. newPosDist is a DiscreteDistribution object, where for each position p in self.allPositions, newPosDist[p] is the probability that the ghost is at position p at time t + 1, given that the ghost is at position oldPos at time t. Note that this call can be fairly expensive, so if your code is timing out, one thing to think about is whether or not you can reduce the number of calls to self.getPositionDistribution.\nSince Pacman is not observing the ghost’s actions, these actions will not impact Pacman’s beliefs. Over time, Pacman’s beliefs will come to reflect places on the board where he believes ghosts are most likely to be given the geometry of the board and ghosts’ possible legal moves, which Pacman already knows.\nFor the tests in this question we will sometimes use a ghost with random movements and other times we will use the GoSouthGhost. This ghost tends to move south so over time, and without any observations, Pacman’s belief distribution should begin to focus around the bottom of the board. To see which ghost is used for each test case you can look in the .test files.\nThe below diagram shows what the Bayes Net/ Hidden Markov model for what is happening.2 Still, you should rely on the above description for implementation because some parts are implemented for you, i.e. getPositionDistribution is abstracted to be \\(P(G_{t+1}∣gameState,G{t})\\).\n2 Only one Ghost is shown– each ghost is independent, given the Pacman position.\n\n\n\n\nTo run the autograder for this question and visualize the output:\npython autograder.py -q q7\nIf you want to run this test (or any of the other tests) without graphics you can add the following flag:\npython autograder.py -q q7 --no-graphics\nAs you watch the autograder output, remember that lighter squares indicate that Pacman believes a ghost is more likely to occupy that location, and darker squares indicate a ghost is less likely to occupy that location. For which of the test cases do you notice differences emerging in the shading of the squares? Can you explain why some squares get lighter and some squares get darker?\n\n\nQ8 (1 pt) Exact Inference Full Test\nNow you will hunt the ghosts.\nWe will use your observeUpdate and elapseTime implementations together to keep an updated belief distribution, and your simple greedy agent will choose an action based on the latest distributions at each time step.\n\nIn the simple greedy strategy, Pacman assumes that each ghost is in its most likely position according to his beliefs, then moves toward the closest ghost.\nUp to this point, Pacman has moved by randomly selecting a valid action.\n\nImplement the chooseAction method in GreedyBustersAgent in bustersAgents.py. Your agent should first find the most likely position of each remaining ghost, then choose an action that minimizes the maze distance to the closest ghost.\nTo find the maze distance between any two positions pos1 and pos2:\nself.distancer.getDistance(pos1, pos2)\nTo find the successor position of a position after an action:\nActions.getSuccessor(position, action)\nYou are provided with livingGhostPositionDistributions, a list of DiscreteDistribution objects representing the position belief distributions for each of the ghosts that are still uncaptured.\nIf correctly implemented, your agent should win the game in q8/3-gameScoreTest with a score greater than 700 at least 8 out of 10 times. Note: the autograder will also check the correctness of your inference directly, but the outcome of games is a reasonable sanity check.\nWe can represent how our greedy agent works with the following modification to the previous diagram:\n\n\n\n\n\nTo run the autograder for this question and visualize the output:\npython autograder.py -q q8\nIf you want to run this test (or any of the other tests) without graphics you can add the following flag:\npython autograder.py -q q8 --no-graphics\n\n\nQ9 (1 pts) Approximate Inference (Initialization and Beliefs)\nApproximate inference is very trendy among ghost hunters this season. For the next few questions, you will implement a particle filtering algorithm for tracking a single ghost.\nFirst, implement the functions initializeUniformly and getBeliefDistribution in the ParticleFilter class in inference.py. A particle (sample) is a ghost position in this inference problem. Note that, for initialization, particles should be evenly (not randomly) distributed across legal positions in order to ensure a uniform prior. We recommend thinking about how the mod operator is useful for initializeUniformly.\nNote that the variable you store your particles in must be a list. A list is simply a collection of unweighted variables (positions in this case). Storing your particles as any other data type, such as a dictionary, is incorrect and will produce errors. The getBeliefDistribution method then takes the list of particles and converts it into a DiscreteDistribution object.\nTo test your code and run the autograder for this question:\npython autograder.py -q q9\n\n\nQ10 (2 pts) Particle Filter - Observation\nNext, we will implement the observeUpdate method in the ParticleFilter class in inference.py. This method constructs a weight distribution over self.particles where the weight of a particle is the probability of the observation given Pacman’s position and that particle location. Then, we resample from this weighted distribution to construct our new list of particles.\nYou should again use the function self.getObservationProb to find the probability of an observation given Pacman’s position, a potential ghost position, and the jail position.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHints\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe sample method of the DiscreteDistribution class will be useful.\nYou can obtain Pacman’s position using gameState.getPacmanPosition(), and the jail position using self.getJailPosition().\nThere is one special case– degeneracy– that a correct implementation must handle. When all particles receive zero weight, the list of particles should be reinitialized by calling initializeUniformly.\n\nThe total method of the DiscreteDistribution may be useful.\n\n\n\n\n\nTo run the autograder for this question and visualize the output:\npython autograder.py -q q10\nIf you want to run this test (or any of the other tests) without graphics you can add the following flag:\npython autograder.py -q q10 --no-graphics\n\n\nQ11 (2 pts) Particle Filter 💪\nImplement the elapseTime method in the ParticleFilter class in inference.py. This function should construct a new list of particles that corresponds to each existing particle in self.particles advancing a time step, and then assign this new list back to self.particles. When complete, you should be able to track ghosts nearly as effectively as with exact inference.\nNote that in this question, we will test both the elapseTime method in isolation, as well as the full implementation of the particle filter combining elapseTime and observe.\nAs in the elapseTime method of the ExactInference class, you should use:\nself.getPositionDistribution(gameState, oldPos)\nThis line of code obtains the distribution over new positions for the ghost, given its previous position (oldPos). The sample method of the DiscreteDistribution class will also be useful.\nTo run the autograder for this question and visualize the output:\npython autograder.py -q q11\nIf you want to run this test (or any of the other tests) without graphics you can add the following flag:\npython autograder.py -q q11 --no-graphics\nNote that even with no graphics, this test may take several minutes to run."

    "text": "The Expr Class\nIn the first part of this project, you will be working with the Expr class defined in logic.py to build propositional logic sentences. An Expr object is implemented as a tree with logical operators (\\(\\land\\), \\(\\lor\\), \\(\\neg\\), \\(\\Rightarrow\\), \\(\\iff\\)) at each node and with literals (A, B, C) at the leaves. Here is an example sentence and its representation:\n(A \\(\\land\\) B) \\(\\iff\\) (\\(\\neg\\) C \\(\\lor\\) D)\n\n\n\n\nExample logic tree.\n\n\n\nTo instantiate a symbol named ‘A’, call the constructor like this:\nA = Expr('A')\nThe Expr class allows you to use Python operators to build up these expressions. The following are the available Python operators and their meanings:\n\n~A: \\(\\neg\\) A\nA & B: A \\(\\land\\) B\nA | B: A \\(\\lor\\) B\nA &gt;&gt; B: A \\(\\Rightarrow\\) B\nA % B: A \\(\\iff\\) B\n\nSo to build the expression A \\(\\land\\) B, you would type this:\nA = Expr('A')\n\nB = Expr('B')\n\na_and_b = A & B\n(Note that A to the left of the assignment operator in that example is just a Python variable name, i.e. symbol1 = Expr('A') would have worked just as well.)\n\nA note on conjoin and disjoin\nOne last important thing to note is that you must use conjoin and disjoin operators wherever possible. conjoin creates a chained & (logical AND) expression, and disjoin creates a chained | (logical OR) expression. Let’s say you wanted to check whether conditions A, B, C, D, and E are all true. The naive way to achieve this is writing condition = A & B & C & D & E, but this actually translates to ((((A & B) & C) & D) & E), which creates a very nested logic tree (see (1) in diagram below) and becomes a nightmare to debug. Instead, conjoin makes a flat tree (see (2) in diagram below).\n\n\n\n\nConoin/Disjoin Examples"

Hint: recall that PropSymbolExpr(str, a1, a2, a3, a4, time=a5) creates the expression str[a1,a2,a3,a4]_a5 where str is a string; you should make some strings for this problem.

A model is a dictionary of the symbols in your expression and a corresponding assignment of True or False. Test your sentence1(), sentence2(), and sentence3() with findModel by opening an interactive session in Python and running from logicPlan import * and findModel(sentence1()) and similar queries for the other two. Do they match what you thought?\nBased on the above, fill in findModelCheck so that it returns something that looks the exact same as findModel(Expr('a')) in a Python interactive session would if lower-cased letters were allowed. You should not use findModel or Expr, simply directly recreate the output. For instance, if the output was [(MyVariable, True)], something close to the solution would be return [(\"MyVariable\", True)].\n\n\nentails(premise, conclusion): Return True if and only if the premise entails the conclusion. Hint: findModel is helpful here; think about what must be unsatisfiable in order for the entails to be True, and what it means for something to be unstatisfiable.\nplTrueInverse(assignments, inverse_statement): Returns True if and only if the (not inverse_statement) is True given assignments.\n\nBefore you continue, try instantiating a small sentence, e.g. A \\(\\land\\) B \\(\\Rightarrow\\) C, and call to_cnf on it. Inspect the output and make sure you understand it (refer to Russell & Norvig, Section 7.5.2, for details on the algorithm to_cnf implements).\nTo test and debug your code run:\npython autograder.py -q q1"

You may NOT use the to_cnf function in your method implementations (or any of the helper functions logic.eliminate_implications, logic.move_not_inwards, and logic.distribute_and_over_or).\nDon’t run to_cnf on your knowledge base when implementing your planning agents in later questions. This is because to_cnf makes your logical expression much longer sometimes, so you want to minimize this effect, and findModel does this already. In later questions, reuse your implementations for atLeastOne(.), atMostOne(.), and exactlyOne(.) instead of re-engineering these functions (to avoid accidentally making an unreasonably slow non-CNF-based implementation) from scratch.\nYou may utilize the logic.pl_true function to test the output of your expressions. pl_true takes an expression and a model and returns True if and only if the expression is true given the model.\nTo test and debug your code run:\npython autograder.py -q q2"

    "text": "Question 3 (4 points): Pacphysics and Satisfiability\nIn this question, you will implement the basic pacphysics logical expressions, as well as learn how to prove where pacman is and isn’t by building an appropriate knowledge base (KB) of logical expressions.\nImplement the following functions in logicPlan.py:\n\npacmanSuccessorAxiomSingle: This generates an expression defining the sufficient and necessary conditions for Pacman to be at (x, y) at t:\nRead the construction of possible_causes provided.\nYou need to fill out the return statement, which will be an Expr. Make sure to use disjoin and conjoin where appropriate. Looking at SLAMSuccessorAxiomSingle may be helpful, although note that the rules there are more complicated than in this function. The simpler side of the biconditional should be on the left for autograder purposes.\npacphysicsAxioms: Here, you will generate a bunch of physics axioms. For timestep t:\nArguments:\nRequired: t = time, all_coords and non_outer_wall_coords are lists of (x, y) tuples.\nPossibly-None: You will be using these to call functions, not much logic is required.\n\nwalls_grid is only passed through to successorAxioms and describes (known) walls.\nsensorModel(t: int, non_outer_wall_coords) -&gt; Expr returns a single Expr describing observation rules; you can take a look at sensorAxioms and SLAMSensorAxioms to see examples of this.\nsuccessorAxioms(t: int, walls_grid, non_outer_wall_coords) -&gt; Expr describes transition rules, e.g. how previous locations and actions of Pacman affect the current location; we have seen this in the functions in the previous bullet point. ONLY CALL THIS IF NECESSARY (when there are grid walls, and t!= 0)\n\nAlgorithm:\nFor all (x, y) in all_coords, append the following implication (if-then form): if a wall is at (x, y), then Pacman is not at (x, y) at t.\nPacman is at exactly one of the non_outer_wall_coords at timestep t.\nPacman takes exactly one of the four actions in DIRECTIONS at timestep t.\nSensors: append the result of sensorAxioms. All callers except for checkLocationSatisfiability make use of this; how to handle the case where we don’t want any sensor axioms added is up to you.\nTransitions: append the result of successorAxioms. All callers will use this.\nAdd each of the sentences above to pacphysics_sentences. As you can see in the return statement, these will be conjoined and returned.\nFunction passing syntax:\nLet def myFunction(x, y, t): return PropSymbolExpr('hello', x, y, time=t) be a function we want to use.\nLet def myCaller(func: Callable): ... be the caller that wants to use a function.\nWe can pass the function in: myCaller(myFunction) (note that myFunction is not called with () after it).\nWe can use myFunction by having inside myCaller this: useful_return = func(0, 1, q).\ncheckLocationSatisfiability: Given a transition (x0_y0, action0, x1_y1), action1, and a problem, you will write a function that will return a tuple of two models (model1, model2).\n\nIn model1, Pacman is at (x1, y1) at time t = 1 given x0_y0, action0, action1, proving that it’s possible that Pacman there. Notably, if model1 is False, we know Pacman is guaranteed to NOT be there.\nIn model2, Pacman is NOT at (x1, y1) at time t = 1 given x0_y0, action0, action1, proving that it’s possible that Pacman is not there. Notably, if model2 is False, we know Pacman is guaranteed to be there.\naction1 has no effect on determining whether the Pacman is at the location; it’s there just to match your solution to the autograder solution.\nTo implement this problem, you will need to add the following expressions to your KB:\nAdd to KB: pacphysics_axioms(...) with the appropriate timesteps. There is no sensorModel because we know everything about the world. Where needed, use allLegalSuccessorAxioms for transitions since this is for regular Pacman transition rules.\nAdd to KB: Pacman’s current location (x0, y0)\nAdd to KB: Pacman takes action0\nAdd to KB: Pacman takes action1\nQuery the SAT solver with findModel for two models described earlier. The queries should be different; for a reminder on how to make queries see entails.\n\n\nReminder: the variable for whether Pacman is at (x, y) at time t is PropSymbolExpr(pacman_str, x, y, time=t), wall exists at (x, y) is PropSymbolExpr(wall_str, x, y), and action is taken at t is PropSymbolExpr(action, time=t).\nTo test and debug your code run:\npython autograder.py -q q3"

Implement the following method using propositional logic to plan Pacman’s sequence of actions leading him to the goal:\nDisclaimer: the methods from now on will be decently slow. This is because a SAT solver is very general and simply crunches logic, unlike our previous algorithms that employ a specific human-created algorithm to specific type of problem. Of note, Pycosat’s main algorithm is in C, which is generally a much much faster language to execute than Python, and it’s still this slow.\n\npositionLogicPlan(problem): Given an instance of logicPlan.PlanningProblem, returns a sequence of action strings for the Pacman agent to execute.\n\nYou will not be implementing a search algorithm, but creating expressions that represent pacphysics for all possible positions at each time step. This means that at each time step, you should be adding general rules for all possible locations on the grid, where the rules do not assume anything about Pacman’s current position.\nYou will need to code up the following sentences for your knowledge base, in the following pseudocode form:\n\nAdd to KB: Initial knowledge: Pacman’s initial location at timestep 0\nfor t in range(50). (Autograder will not test on layouts requiring \\(\\geq\\) 50 timesteps.)\nPrint time step; this is to see that the code is running and how far it is.\nAdd to KB: Initial knowledge: Pacman can only be at exactlyOne of the locations in non_wall_coords at timestep t. This is similar to pacphysicsAxioms, but don’t use that method since we are using non_wall_coors when generating the list of possible locations in the first place (and walls_grid later).\nIs there a satisfying assignment for the variables given the knowledge base so far? Use findModel and pass in the Goal Assertion and KB.\nIf there is, return a sequence of actions from start to goal using extractActionSequence.\nHere, Goal Assertion is the expression asserting that Pacman is at the goal at timestep t.\nAdd to KB: Pacman takes exactly one action per timestep.\nAdd to KB: Transition Model sentences: call pacmanSuccessorAxiomSingle(...) for all possible pacman positions in non_wall_coords.\n\nTest your code on smaller mazes using:\npython pacman.py -l maze2x2 -p LogicAgent -a fn=plp\npython pacman.py -l tinyMaze -p LogicAgent -a fn=plp\nTo test and debug your code run:\npython autograder.py -q q4\nNote that with the way we have Pacman’s grid laid out, the leftmost, bottommost space occupiable by Pacman (assuming there isn’t a wall there) is (1, 1), as shown below (not (0, 0)).\n\n\n\nSummary of Pacphysics used in Q3 and Q4:\n\nFor all x, y, t: if there is a wall at (x, y), then pacman is not at (x, y) at t.\nFor each t: Pacman is at exactly on of the locations described by all possible (x, y). Can be optimized with knowledge of outer or all walls, follow spec for each function.\nFor each t: Pacman takes exactly on of the possible actions.\nFor each t (except for t = ??): Transition model: Pacman is at (x, y) at t if and only if he was at (join with or: (x - dx, y - dy) at t-1 and took action (dx, dy) at t-1).\n\nNote that the above always hold true regardless of any specific game, actions, etc. To the above always-true/ axiom rules, we add information consistent with what we know.\nDebugging hints:\n\nIf you’re finding a length-0 or a length-1 solution: is it enough to simply have axioms for where Pacman is at a given time? What’s to prevent him from also being in other places?\nAs a sanity check, verify that if Pacman is at (1, 1) at time 0 and at (4, 4) at time 6, he was never at (5, 5) at any time in between.\nIf your solution is taking more than a couple minutes to finish running, you may want to revisit implementation of exactlyOne and atMostOne, and ensure that you’re using as few clauses as possible."

Additionally, in our setup of SLAM, Pacman no longer has a 4 bit sensor that tells us whether there is a wall in the four directions, but only has a 3-bit sensor that reveals the number of walls he is adjacent to.

    "text": "4 Q1 (3 pts): Depth First Search\n(3 pts) In searchAgents.py, you’ll find a fully implemented SearchAgent, which plans out a path through Pacman’s world and then executes that path step-by-step. The search algorithms for formulating a plan are not implemented – that’s your job.\nFirst, test that the SearchAgent is working correctly by running:\npython pacman.py -l tinyMaze -p SearchAgent -a fn=tinyMazeSearch\nThe command above tells the SearchAgent to use tinyMazeSearch as its search algorithm, which is implemented in search.py. Pacman should navigate the maze successfully.\nNow it’s time to write full-fledged generic search functions to help Pacman plan routes! Pseudocode for the search algorithms you’ll write can be found in the lecture slides. Remember that a search node must contain not only a state but also the information necessary to reconstruct the path (plan) which gets to that state.\nImportant note: All of your search functions need to return a list of actions that will lead the agent from the start to the goal. These actions all have to be legal moves (valid directions, no moving through walls).\nImportant note: Make sure to use the Stack, Queue and PriorityQueue data structures provided to you in util.py! These data structure implementations have particular properties which are required for compatibility with the autograder.\nHint: Each algorithm is very similar. Algorithms for DFS, BFS, UCS, and A* differ only in the details of how the fringe is managed. So, concentrate on getting DFS right and the rest should be relatively straightforward. Indeed, one possible implementation requires only a single generic search method which is configured with an algorithm-specific queuing strategy. (Your implementation need not be of this form to receive full credit).\nImplement the depth-first search (DFS) algorithm in the depthFirstSearch function in search.py. To make your algorithm complete, write the graph search version of DFS, which avoids expanding any already visited states.\nYour code should quickly find a solution for:\npython pacman.py -l tinyMaze -p SearchAgent\npython pacman.py -l mediumMaze -p SearchAgent\npython pacman.py -l bigMaze -z .5 -p SearchAgent\nThe Pacman board will show an overlay of the states explored, and the order in which they were explored (brighter red means earlier exploration). Is the exploration order what you would have expected? Does Pacman actually go to all the explored squares on his way to the goal?\nHint: If you use a Stack as your data structure, the solution found by your DFS algorithm for mediumMaze should have a length of 130 (provided you push successors onto the fringe in the order provided by getSuccessors; you might get 246 if you push them in the reverse order). Is this a least cost solution? If not, think about what depth-first search is doing wrong.\nGrading: Please run the below command to see if your implementation passes all the autograder test cases.\npython autograder.py -q q1"

Consider mediumDottedMaze and mediumScaryMaze.\nBy changing the cost function, we can encourage Pacman to find different paths. For example, we can charge more for dangerous steps in ghost-ridden areas or less for steps in food-rich areas, and a rational Pacman agent should adjust its behavior in response.\nImplement the uniform-cost graph search algorithm in the uniformCostSearch function in search.py. We encourage you to look through util.py for some data structures that may be useful in your implementation. You should now observe successful behavior in all three of the following layouts, where the agents below are all UCS agents that differ only in the cost function they use (the agents and cost functions are written for you):\npython pacman.py -l mediumMaze -p SearchAgent -a fn=ucs\npython pacman.py -l mediumDottedMaze -p StayEastSearchAgent\npython pacman.py -l mediumScaryMaze -p StayWestSearchAgent\nNote: You should get very low and very high path costs for the StayEastSearchAgent and StayWestSearchAgent respectively, due to their exponential cost functions (see searchAgents.py for details).\nGrading: Please run the below command to see if your implementation passes all the autograder test cases.\npython autograder.py -q q3"

Now, it’s time to formulate a new problem and design a heuristic for it.\nIn corner mazes, there are four dots, one in each corner. Our new search problem is to find the shortest path through the maze that touches all four corners (whether the maze actually has food there or not). Note that for some mazes like tinyCorners, the shortest path does not always go to the closest food first! Hint: the shortest path through tinyCorners takes 28 steps.\nNote: Make sure to complete Question 2 before working on Question 5, because Question 5 builds upon your answer for Question 2.\nImplement the CornersProblem search problem in searchAgents.py. You will need to choose a state representation that encodes all the information necessary to detect whether all four corners have been reached. Now, your search agent should solve:\npython pacman.py -l tinyCorners -p SearchAgent -a fn=bfs,prob=CornersProblem\npython pacman.py -l mediumCorners -p SearchAgent -a fn=bfs,prob=CornersProblem\nTo receive full credit, you need to define an abstract state representation that does not encode irrelevant information (like the position of ghosts, where extra food is, etc.). In particular, do not use a Pacman GameState as a search state. Your code will be very, very slow if you do (and also wrong).\nAn instance of the CornersProblem class represents an entire search problem, not a particular state. Particular states are returned by the functions you write, and your functions return a data structure of your choosing (e.g. tuple, set, etc.) that represents a state.\nFurthermore, while a program is running, remember that many states simultaneously exist, all on the queue of the search algorithm, and they should be independent of each other. In other words, you should not have only one state for the entire CornersProblem object; your class should be able to generate many different states to provide to the search algorithm.\nHint 1: The only parts of the game state you need to reference in your implementation are the starting Pacman position and the location of the four corners.\nHint 2: When coding up getSuccessors, make sure to add children to your successors list with a cost of 1.\nOur implementation of breadthFirstSearch expands just under 2000 search nodes on mediumCorners.

More effective heuristics will return values closer to the actual goal costs. To be admissible, the heuristic values must be lower bounds on the actual shortest path cost to the nearest goal (and non-negative). To be consistent, it must additionally hold that if an action has cost c, then taking that action can only cause a drop in heuristic of at most c.\nRemember that admissibility isn’t enough to guarantee correctness in graph search – you need the stronger condition of consistency. However, admissible heuristics are usually also consistent, especially if they are derived from problem relaxations. Therefore it is usually easiest to start out by brainstorming admissible heuristics. Once you have an admissible heuristic that works well, you can check whether it is indeed consistent, too. The only way to guarantee consistency is with a proof. However, inconsistency can often be detected by verifying that for each node you expand, its successor nodes are equal or higher in in f-value. Moreover, if UCS and A* ever return paths of different lengths, your heuristic is inconsistent. This stuff is tricky!\nNon-Trivial Heuristics: The trivial heuristics are the ones that return zero everywhere (UCS) and the heuristic which computes the true completion cost. The former won’t save you any time, while the latter will timeout the autograder. You want a heuristic which reduces total compute time, though for this assignment the autograder will only check node counts (aside from enforcing a reasonable time limit).\nGrading: Your heuristic must be a non-trivial non-negative consistent heuristic to receive any points. Make sure that your heuristic returns 0 at every goal state and never returns a negative value.

    "text": "10 Q7 (4 pts): Eating All The Dots\nNow we’ll solve a hard search problem: eating all the Pacman food in as few steps as possible. For this, we’ll need a new search problem definition which formalizes the food-clearing problem: FoodSearchProblem in searchAgents.py (implemented for you). A solution is defined to be a path that collects all of the food in the Pacman world. For the present project, solutions do not take into account any ghosts or power pellets; solutions only depend on the placement of walls, regular food and Pacman. (Of course ghosts can ruin the execution of a solution! We’ll get to that in the next project.) If you have written your general search methods correctly, A* with a null heuristic (equivalent to uniform-cost search) should quickly find an optimal solution to testSearch with no code change on your part (total cost of 7).\npython pacman.py -l testSearch -p AStarFoodSearchAgent\nNote: AStarFoodSearchAgent is a shortcut for\n-p SearchAgent -a fn=astar,prob=FoodSearchProblem,heuristic=foodHeuristic\nYou should find that UCS starts to slow down even for the seemingly simple tinySearch.

The provided reflex agent code provides some helpful examples of methods that query the GameState for information. A capable reflex agent will have to consider both food locations and ghost locations to perform well. Your agent should easily and reliably clear the testClassic layout:\npython pacman.py -p ReflexAgent -l testClassic\nTry out your reflex agent on the default mediumClassic layout with one ghost or two (and animation off to speed up the display):\npython pacman.py --frameTime 0 -p ReflexAgent -k 1\npython pacman.py --frameTime 0 -p ReflexAgent -k 2\nHow does your agent fare? It will likely often die with 2 ghosts on the default board, unless your evaluation function is quite good.\nNote: Remember that newFood has the function asList()\nNote: As features, try the reciprocal of important values (such as distance to food) rather than just the values themselves.\nNote: The evaluation function you’re writing is evaluating state-action pairs; in later parts of the assignment, you’ll be evaluating states.\nNote: You may find it useful to view the internal contents of various objects for debugging. You can do this by printing the objects’ string representations. For example, you can print newGhostStates with print(newGhostStates).\nOptions: Default ghosts are random; you can also play for fun with slightly smarter directional ghosts using -g DirectionalGhost. If the randomness is preventing you from telling whether your agent is improving, you can use -f to run with a fixed random seed (same random choices every game). You can also play multiple games in a row with -n. Turn off graphics with -q to run lots of games quickly.\nGrading: We will run your agent on the openClassic layout 10 times. You will receive 0 points if your agent times out, or never wins. You will receive 1 point if your agent wins at least 5 times, or 2 points if your agent wins all 10 games. You will receive an additional 1 point if your agent’s average score is greater than 500, or 2 points if it is greater than 1000. You can try your agent out under these conditions with\npython autograder.py -q q1\nTo run it without graphics, use:\npython autograder.py -q q1 --no-graphics"

In particular, your minimax tree will have multiple min layers (one for each ghost) for every max layer.\nYour code should also expand the game tree to an arbitrary depth. Score the leaves of your minimax tree with the supplied self.evaluationFunction, which defaults to scoreEvaluationFunction. MinimaxAgent extends MultiAgentSearchAgent, which gives access to self.depth and self.evaluationFunction. Make sure your minimax code makes reference to these two variables where appropriate as these variables are populated in response to command line options.\nImportant: A single search ply is considered to be one Pacman move and all the ghosts’ responses, so depth 2 search will involve Pacman and each ghost moving two times (see diagram below).\n\n\n\nMinimax tree with depth 2\n\n\nGrading: We will be checking your code to determine whether it explores the correct number of game states. This is the only reliable way to detect some very subtle bugs in implementations of minimax. As a result, the autograder will be very picky about how many times you call GameState.generateSuccessor. If you call it any more or less than necessary, the autograder will complain. To test and debug your code, run\npython autograder.py -q q2\nThis will show what your algorithm does on a number of small trees, as well as a pacman game. To run it without graphics, use:\npython autograder.py -q q2 --no-graphics\n\n4.1 Hints and Observations\n\nImplement the algorithm recursively using helper function(s).\nThe correct implementation of minimax will lead to Pacman losing the game in some tests. This is not a problem: as it is correct behavior, it will pass the tests for full credit.\nThe evaluation function for the Pacman test in this part is already written (self.evaluationFunction). You shouldn’t change this function, but recognize that now we’re evaluating states rather than actions, as we were for the reflex agent. Look-ahead agents evaluate future states whereas reflex agents evaluate actions from the current state.\nThe minimax values of the initial state in the minimaxClassic layout are 9, 8, 7, -492 for depths 1, 2, 3 and 4 respectively. Note that your minimax agent will often win (665/1000 games for us) despite the dire prediction of depth 4 minimax.\n  python pacman.py -p MinimaxAgent -l minimaxClassic -a depth=4\nPacman is always agent 0, and the agents move in order of increasing agent index.\nAll states in minimax should be GameStates, either passed in to getAction or generated via GameState.generateSuccessor. You will not be abstracting to simplified states.\nOn larger boards such as openClassic and mediumClassic (the default), you’ll find Pacman to be good at not dying, but quite bad at winning. He’ll often thrash around without making progress. He might even thrash around right next to a dot without eating it because he doesn’t know where he’d go after eating that dot. Don’t worry if you see this behavior, question 5 will clean up all of these issues.\nWhen the Pacman believes that his death is unavoidable, he will try to end the game as soon as possible because of the constant penalty for living. Sometimes, this is the wrong thing to do with random ghosts, but minimax agents always assume the worst:\n  python pacman.py -p MinimaxAgent -l trappedClassic -a depth=3\nMake sure you understand why Pacman rushes the closest ghost in this case."

    "text": "5 Q3 (5 pts): Alpha-Beta Pruning\nMake a new agent that uses alpha-beta pruning to more efficiently explore the minimax tree, in AlphaBetaAgent. Again, your algorithm will be slightly more general than the pseudocode from lecture, so part of the challenge is to extend the alpha-beta pruning logic appropriately to multiple minimizer agents.\nYou should see a speed-up (perhaps depth 3 alpha-beta will run as fast as depth 2 minimax). Ideally, depth 3 on smallClassic should run in just a few seconds per move or faster.\npython pacman.py -p AlphaBetaAgent -a depth=3 -l smallClassic\nThe AlphaBetaAgent minimax values should be identical to the MinimaxAgent minimax values, although the actions it selects can vary because of different tie-breaking behavior. Again, the minimax values of the initial state in the minimaxClassic layout are 9, 8, 7 and -492 for depths 1, 2, 3 and 4 respectively.\nGrading: Because we check your code to determine whether it explores the correct number of states, it is important that you perform alpha-beta pruning without reordering children. In other words, successor states should always be processed in the order returned by GameState.getLegalActions. Again, do not call GameState.generateSuccessor more than necessary.\nYou must not prune on equality in order to match the set of states explored by our autograder. (Indeed, alternatively, but incompatible with our autograder, would be to also allow for pruning on equality and invoke alpha-beta once on each child of the root node, but this will not match the autograder.)\nThe pseudo-code below represents the algorithm you should implement for this question. It varies from the reference implementation of Alpha-Beta pruning in the text/lecture by capturing more than two agents with a scalar value \\(v\\) (because the ghosts are all cooperating to defeat the Pacman).\n\n\n\\begin{algorithm} \\caption{Alpha-Beta Pruning} \\begin{algorithmic} \\Function{Max-Value}{$state, \\alpha, \\beta$} \\State $v \\gets -\\infty$ \\State $successors \\gets$ \\textsc{Expand}($state$) \\For{\\textbf{each} $s$ \\textbf{in} $successors$} \\State $v \\gets$ \\Call{Max}{$v$, \\textsc{Min-Value}($successor, \\alpha, \\beta$)} \\If{$v &gt; \\beta$} \\State \\textbf{return} $v$ \\EndIf \\State $\\alpha \\gets$ \\Call{Max}{$\\alpha, v$} \\EndFor \\State \\textbf{return} $v$ \\EndFunction \\State \\Function{Min-Value}{$state, \\alpha, \\beta$} \\State $v \\gets \\infty$ \\State $successors \\gets$ \\textsc{Expand}($state$) \\For{\\textbf{each} $s$ \\textbf{in} $successors$} \\State $v \\gets$ \\Call{Min}{$v$, \\textsc{Value}($successor, \\alpha, \\beta$)} \\If{$v &lt; \\alpha$} \\State \\textbf{return} $v$ \\EndIf \\State $\\beta \\gets$ \\Call{Min}{$\\beta, v$} \\EndFor \\State \\textbf{return} $v$ \\EndFunction \\State \\Function{Value}{$state, \\alpha, \\beta$} \\If{\\Call{NextAgent}{$state$} is $Max$} \\State \\textbf{return} \\Call{Max-Value}{$state, \\alpha, \\beta$} \\EndIf \\State \\textbf{return} \\Call{Min-Value}{$state, \\alpha, \\beta$} \\EndFunction \\end{algorithmic} \\end{algorithm}\n\n\nTo test and debug your code, run\npython autograder.py -q q3\nThis will show what your algorithm does on a number of small trees, as well as a pacman game.

    "text": "6 Q4 (5 pts): Expectimax\nMinimax and alpha-beta are great, but they both assume that you are playing against an adversary who makes optimal decisions. As anyone who has ever won tic-tac-toe can tell you, this is not always the case. In this question you will implement the ExpectimaxAgent, which is useful for modeling probabilistic behavior of agents who may make suboptimal choices.\nAs with the search and problems yet to be covered in this class, the beauty of these algorithms is their general applicability. To expedite your own development, we’ve supplied some test cases based on generic trees. You can debug your implementation on small the game trees using the command:\npython autograder.py -q q4\nDebugging on these small and manageable test cases is recommended and will help you to find bugs quickly.\nOnce your algorithm is working on small trees, you can observe its success in Pacman. Random ghosts are of course not optimal minimax agents, and so modeling them with minimax search may not be appropriate. ExpectimaxAgent will no longer take the min over all ghost actions, but the expectation according to your agent’s model of how the ghosts act. To simplify your code, assume you will only be running against an adversary which chooses amongst their getLegalActions uniformly at random.\nTo see how the ExpectimaxAgent behaves in Pacman, run:\npython pacman.py -p ExpectimaxAgent -l minimaxClassic -a depth=3\nYou should now observe a more cavalier approach in close quarters with ghosts. In particular, if Pacman perceives that he could be trapped but might escape to grab a few more pieces of food, he’ll at least try. Investigate the results of these two scenarios:\npython pacman.py -p AlphaBetaAgent -l trappedClassic -a depth=3 -q -n 10\npython pacman.py -p ExpectimaxAgent -l trappedClassic -a depth=3 -q -n 10\nYou should find that your ExpectimaxAgent wins about half the time, while your AlphaBetaAgent always loses. Make sure you understand why the behavior here differs from the minimax case.\nThe correct implementation of expectimax will lead to Pacman losing some of the tests. This is not a problem: as it is correct behaviour, it will pass the tests."
