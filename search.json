Don’t let other people copy your solutions, and don’t copy solutions from other people, from websites, or from other sources.\nThe challenge from this course is largely in understanding how decision-making algorithms work and how/when to apply them to problems. Discussing these concepts with others is always permitted, and is strongly encouraged. Likewise, helping a peer resolve a bug is permitted.\nIf you feel like a discussion with any person (including the professor) helped you answer a homework problem, include their name(s) in your comments at the start of that problem, and near the part you got help on. In the event your collaboration exceeds what is permitted, any penalty will be substantially reduced (or waived) if such a thing is an honest mistake as evidenced by these comments. If you aren’t sure: ask.\nIf I discover at any point during or after the semester that you have violated the collaboration policy, you will be formally referred to the Office of Student Rights and Responsibilities for Academic Dishonesty. In addition to failing the assignment, your final grade in the class will be reduced by a full letter grade. This policy is not a game. Do not attempt to circumvent it.\n\nGenerative Artificial Intelligence / Large Language Models\nCopying solutions for homework assignments from an AI assistant or Large Language Model such as (but not limited to) ChatGPT, Copilot, or Claude will be treated the same as copying it from another person or from any other online resource. It is not permitted on any homework assignment, and it is considered cheating.\n\n\nYou Can Search Your Errors\nCopying code snippets from Stack Overflow, language documentation, or similar is permitted, however please indicate when you have done this with a comment in your code citing the resource. If you have become accustomed to using LLMs for these searches, I expect you to verify the answers with language/library documentation and cite the documentation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUniversity Policies\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAcademic Integrity Code\nAcademic integrity is an essential part of the educational process, and all members of the GW community take these matters very seriously. As the instructor of record for this course, my role is to provide clear expectations and uphold them in all assessments. Violations of academic integrity occur when students fail to cite research sources properly, engage in unauthorized collaboration, falsify data, and otherwise violate the Code of Academic Integrity. If you have any questions about whether or not particular academic practices or resources are permitted, you should ask me for clarification. If you are reported for an academic integrity violation, you should contact the Office of Student Rights and Responsibilities (SRR) to learn more about your rights and options in the process. Consequences can range from failure of assignment to expulsion from the university and may include a transcript notation. For more information, please refer to the SRR website, email rights@gwu.edu, or call 202-994-6757.\n\n\nUniversity Policy on Observance of Religious Holidays\nStudents must notify faculty during the first week of the semester in which they are enrolled in the course, or as early as possible, but no later than three weeks prior to the absence, of their intention to be absent from class on their day(s) of religious observance. If the holiday falls within the first three weeks of class, the student must inform faculty in the first week of the semester. For details and policy, see “Religious Holidays” at Provost Policies, Procedures, and Guidelines.\n\n\nUse of Electronic Course Materials and Class Recordings\nStudents are encouraged to use electronic course materials, including recorded class sessions, for private personal use in connection with their academic program of study. Electronic course materials and recorded class sessions should not be shared or used for non-course related purposes unless express permission has been granted by the instructor. Students who impermissibly share any electronic course materials are subject to discipline under the Student Code of Conduct.

    "text": "4 Q1 (3 pts): Depth First Search\n(3 pts) In searchAgents.py, you’ll find a fully implemented SearchAgent, which plans out a path through Pacman’s world and then executes that path step-by-step. The search algorithms for formulating a plan are not implemented – that’s your job.\nFirst, test that the SearchAgent is working correctly by running:\npython pacman.py -l tinyMaze -p SearchAgent -a fn=tinyMazeSearch\nThe command above tells the SearchAgent to use tinyMazeSearch as its search algorithm, which is implemented in search.py. Pacman should navigate the maze successfully.\nNow it’s time to write full-fledged generic search functions to help Pacman plan routes! Pseudocode for the search algorithms you’ll write can be found in the lecture slides. Remember that a search node must contain not only a state but also the information necessary to reconstruct the path (plan) which gets to that state.\nImportant note: All of your search functions need to return a list of actions that will lead the agent from the start to the goal. These actions all have to be legal moves (valid directions, no moving through walls).\nImportant note: Make sure to use the Stack, Queue and PriorityQueue data structures provided to you in util.py! These data structure implementations have particular properties which are required for compatibility with the autograder.\nHint: Each algorithm is very similar. Algorithms for DFS, BFS, UCS, and A* differ only in the details of how the fringe is managed. So, concentrate on getting DFS right and the rest should be relatively straightforward. Indeed, one possible implementation requires only a single generic search method which is configured with an algorithm-specific queuing strategy. (Your implementation need not be of this form to receive full credit).\nImplement the depth-first search (DFS) algorithm in the depthFirstSearch function in search.py. To make your algorithm complete, write the graph search version of DFS, which avoids expanding any already visited states.\nYour code should quickly find a solution for:\npython pacman.py -l tinyMaze -p SearchAgent\npython pacman.py -l mediumMaze -p SearchAgent\npython pacman.py -l bigMaze -z .5 -p SearchAgent\nThe Pacman board will show an overlay of the states explored, and the order in which they were explored (brighter red means earlier exploration). Is the exploration order what you would have expected? Does Pacman actually go to all the explored squares on his way to the goal?\nHint: If you use a Stack as your data structure, the solution found by your DFS algorithm for mediumMaze should have a length of 130 (provided you push successors onto the fringe in the order provided by getSuccessors; you might get 246 if you push them in the reverse order). Is this a least cost solution? If not, think about what depth-first search is doing wrong.\nGrading: Please run the below command to see if your implementation passes all the autograder test cases.\npython autograder.py -q q1"

Consider mediumDottedMaze and mediumScaryMaze.\nBy changing the cost function, we can encourage Pacman to find different paths. For example, we can charge more for dangerous steps in ghost-ridden areas or less for steps in food-rich areas, and a rational Pacman agent should adjust its behavior in response.\nImplement the uniform-cost graph search algorithm in the uniformCostSearch function in search.py. We encourage you to look through util.py for some data structures that may be useful in your implementation. You should now observe successful behavior in all three of the following layouts, where the agents below are all UCS agents that differ only in the cost function they use (the agents and cost functions are written for you):\npython pacman.py -l mediumMaze -p SearchAgent -a fn=ucs\npython pacman.py -l mediumDottedMaze -p StayEastSearchAgent\npython pacman.py -l mediumScaryMaze -p StayWestSearchAgent\nNote: You should get very low and very high path costs for the StayEastSearchAgent and StayWestSearchAgent respectively, due to their exponential cost functions (see searchAgents.py for details).\nGrading: Please run the below command to see if your implementation passes all the autograder test cases.\npython autograder.py -q q3"

Now, it’s time to formulate a new problem and design a heuristic for it.\nIn corner mazes, there are four dots, one in each corner. Our new search problem is to find the shortest path through the maze that touches all four corners (whether the maze actually has food there or not). Note that for some mazes like tinyCorners, the shortest path does not always go to the closest food first! Hint: the shortest path through tinyCorners takes 28 steps.\nNote: Make sure to complete Question 2 before working on Question 5, because Question 5 builds upon your answer for Question 2.\nImplement the CornersProblem search problem in searchAgents.py. You will need to choose a state representation that encodes all the information necessary to detect whether all four corners have been reached. Now, your search agent should solve:\npython pacman.py -l tinyCorners -p SearchAgent -a fn=bfs,prob=CornersProblem\npython pacman.py -l mediumCorners -p SearchAgent -a fn=bfs,prob=CornersProblem\nTo receive full credit, you need to define an abstract state representation that does not encode irrelevant information (like the position of ghosts, where extra food is, etc.). In particular, do not use a Pacman GameState as a search state. Your code will be very, very slow if you do (and also wrong).\nAn instance of the CornersProblem class represents an entire search problem, not a particular state. Particular states are returned by the functions you write, and your functions return a data structure of your choosing (e.g. tuple, set, etc.) that represents a state.\nFurthermore, while a program is running, remember that many states simultaneously exist, all on the queue of the search algorithm, and they should be independent of each other. In other words, you should not have only one state for the entire CornersProblem object; your class should be able to generate many different states to provide to the search algorithm.\nHint 1: The only parts of the game state you need to reference in your implementation are the starting Pacman position and the location of the four corners.\nHint 2: When coding up getSuccessors, make sure to add children to your successors list with a cost of 1.\nOur implementation of breadthFirstSearch expands just under 2000 search nodes on mediumCorners. However, heuristics (used with A* search) can reduce the amount of searching required.\nGrading: Please run the below command to see if your implementation passes all the autograder test cases.\npython autograder.py -q q5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHeuristics\n\n\n\nIt’s possible to code a “heuristic” that finds actual path cost using DFS, BFS, or UCS, and doesn’t count those nodes as expansions for the autograder.

More effective heuristics will return values closer to the actual goal costs. To be admissible, the heuristic values must be lower bounds on the actual shortest path cost to the nearest goal (and non-negative). To be consistent, it must additionally hold that if an action has cost c, then taking that action can only cause a drop in heuristic of at most c.\nRemember that admissibility isn’t enough to guarantee correctness in graph search – you need the stronger condition of consistency. However, admissible heuristics are usually also consistent, especially if they are derived from problem relaxations. Therefore it is usually easiest to start out by brainstorming admissible heuristics. Once you have an admissible heuristic that works well, you can check whether it is indeed consistent, too. The only way to guarantee consistency is with a proof. However, inconsistency can often be detected by verifying that for each node you expand, its successor nodes are equal or higher in in f-value. Moreover, if UCS and A* ever return paths of different lengths, your heuristic is inconsistent. This stuff is tricky!\nNon-Trivial Heuristics: The trivial heuristics are the ones that return zero everywhere (UCS) and the ‘heuristic’ which computes the true completion cost. The former won’t save you any time, while the latter will usually timeout the autograder. You want a heuristic which reduces total compute time, though for this assignment the autograder will only check node counts (aside from enforcing a reasonable time limit).\nGrading: Your heuristic must be a non-trivial non-negative consistent heuristic to receive any points. Make sure that your heuristic returns 0 at every goal state and never returns a negative value.

A solution is defined to be a path that collects all of the food in the Pacman world. For the present project, solutions do not take into account any ghosts or power pellets; solutions only depend on the placement of walls, regular food and Pacman. (Of course ghosts can ruin the execution of a solution! We’ll get to that in the next project.)

What we’ll need:\n\nStations\nWrite a Python Station class that models a single station on the metro. The stations can be found on the WMATA Map; your class should be “generic” such that it can accommodate any station in the system. These stations:\n\nServe only a single line\nServe multiple lines that are parallel in both directions\nServe multiple lines that are divergent in both directions\nServe multiple lines that are parallel in one direction and divergent in others\n\nYour class should include some way to connect stations in the model as they are connected in the real metro system. There is more than one way to accomplish this: you might implement a class the represents edges, but you don’t have to.\nYour class(es) should also capture information about travel times between stations.3\n3 This travel time isn’t present on the WMATA map. Let us assume it can be quantified.Implement a getSuccessors method for your Station class that returns a tuple of adjacent stations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis Exercise Seems Too Easy\n\n\n\n\n\nPunishment gluttons are encouraged to implement the model for the NYC MTA system instead. The NYC subway has “local” and “express” trains that run on parallel tracks.\n\n\n\n\n\nSearch\nRecall the tree search algorithms you studied as a younger person. These algorithms could be used to determine the path (and from the path, we can calculate travel times).\nTo aid implementation of tree search algorithms for this problem, create a Node class to facilitate the tree representation of the graph problem. This class should include, at a minimum, instance variables that reference a Station and a parent Node."
