The provided reflex agent code provides some helpful examples of methods that query the GameState for information. A capable reflex agent will have to consider both food locations and ghost locations to perform well. Your agent should easily and reliably clear the testClassic layout:\npython pacman.py -p ReflexAgent -l testClassic\nTry out your reflex agent on the default mediumClassic layout with one ghost or two (and animation off to speed up the display):\npython pacman.py --frameTime 0 -p ReflexAgent -k 1\npython pacman.py --frameTime 0 -p ReflexAgent -k 2\nHow does your agent fare? It will likely often die with 2 ghosts on the default board, unless your evaluation function is quite good.\nNote: Remember that newFood has the function asList()\nNote: As features, try the reciprocal of important values (such as distance to food) rather than just the values themselves.\nNote: The evaluation function you’re writing is evaluating state-action pairs; in later parts of the assignment, you’ll be evaluating states.\nNote: You may find it useful to view the internal contents of various objects for debugging. You can do this by printing the objects’ string representations. For example, you can print newGhostStates with print(newGhostStates).\nOptions: Default ghosts are random; you can also play for fun with slightly smarter directional ghosts using -g DirectionalGhost. If the randomness is preventing you from telling whether your agent is improving, you can use -f to run with a fixed random seed (same random choices every game). You can also play multiple games in a row with -n. Turn off graphics with -q to run lots of games quickly.\nGrading: We will run your agent on the openClassic layout 10 times. You will receive 0 points if your agent times out, or never wins. You will receive 1 point if your agent wins at least 5 times, or 2 points if your agent wins all 10 games.

    "text": "4 Q2 (5 pts): Minimax\nNow you will write an adversarial search agent in the provided MinimaxAgent class stub in multiAgents.py. Your minimax agent should work with any number of ghosts, so you’ll have to write an algorithm that is slightly more general than what you’ve previously seen in lecture. In particular, your minimax tree will have multiple min layers (one for each ghost) for every max layer.\nYour code should also expand the game tree to an arbitrary depth. Score the leaves of your minimax tree with the supplied self.evaluationFunction, which defaults to scoreEvaluationFunction. MinimaxAgent extends MultiAgentSearchAgent, which gives access to self.depth and self.evaluationFunction. Make sure your minimax code makes reference to these two variables where appropriate as these variables are populated in response to command line options.\nImportant: A single search ply is considered to be one Pacman move and all the ghosts’ responses, so depth 2 search will involve Pacman and each ghost moving two times (see diagram below).\n\n\n\nMinimax tree with depth 2\n\n\nGrading: We will be checking your code to determine whether it explores the correct number of game states. This is the only reliable way to detect some very subtle bugs in implementations of minimax. As a result, the autograder will be very picky about how many times you call GameState.generateSuccessor. If you call it any more or less than necessary, the autograder will complain. To test and debug your code, run\npython autograder.py -q q2\nThis will show what your algorithm does on a number of small trees, as well as a pacman game. To run it without graphics, use:\npython autograder.py -q q2 --no-graphics\n\n4.1 Hints and Observations\n\nImplement the algorithm recursively using helper function(s).\nThe correct implementation of minimax will lead to Pacman losing the game in some tests. This is not a problem: as it is correct behavior, it will pass the tests for full credit.\nThe evaluation function for the Pacman test in this part is already written (self.evaluationFunction). You shouldn’t change this function, but recognize that now we’re evaluating states rather than actions, as we were for the reflex agent. Look-ahead agents evaluate future states whereas reflex agents evaluate actions from the current state.\nThe minimax values of the initial state in the minimaxClassic layout are 9, 8, 7, -492 for depths 1, 2, 3 and 4 respectively. Note that your minimax agent will often win (665/1000 games for us) despite the dire prediction of depth 4 minimax.\n  python pacman.py -p MinimaxAgent -l minimaxClassic -a depth=4\nPacman is always agent 0, and the agents move in order of increasing agent index.\nAll states in minimax should be GameStates, either passed in to getAction or generated via GameState.generateSuccessor. You will not be abstracting to simplified states.\nOn larger boards such as openClassic and mediumClassic (the default), you’ll find Pacman to be good at not dying, but quite bad at winning. He’ll often thrash around without making progress. He might even thrash around right next to a dot without eating it because he doesn’t know where he’d go after eating that dot. Don’t worry if you see this behavior, question 5 will clean up all of these issues.\nWhen the Pacman believes that his death is unavoidable, he will try to end the game as soon as possible because of the constant penalty for living. Sometimes, this is the wrong thing to do with random ghosts, but minimax agents always assume the worst:\n  python pacman.py -p MinimaxAgent -l trappedClassic -a depth=3\nMake sure you understand why Pacman rushes the closest ghost in this case."

Again, your algorithm will be slightly more general than the pseudocode from lecture, so part of the challenge is to extend the alpha-beta pruning logic appropriately to multiple minimizer agents.\nYou should see a speed-up (perhaps depth 3 alpha-beta will run as fast as depth 2 minimax). Ideally, depth 3 on smallClassic should run in just a few seconds per move or faster.\npython pacman.py -p AlphaBetaAgent -a depth=3 -l smallClassic\nThe AlphaBetaAgent minimax values should be identical to the MinimaxAgent minimax values, although the actions it selects can vary because of different tie-breaking behavior. Again, the minimax values of the initial state in the minimaxClassic layout are 9, 8, 7 and -492 for depths 1, 2, 3 and 4 respectively.\nGrading: Because we check your code to determine whether it explores the correct number of states, it is important that you perform alpha-beta pruning without reordering children. In other words, successor states should always be processed in the order returned by GameState.getLegalActions. Again, do not call GameState.generateSuccessor more than necessary.\nYou must not prune on equality in order to match the set of states explored by our autograder. (Indeed, alternatively, but incompatible with our autograder, would be to also allow for pruning on equality and invoke alpha-beta once on each child of the root node, but this will not match the autograder.)\nThe pseudo-code below represents the algorithm you should implement for this question. It varies from the reference implementation of Alpha-Beta pruning in the text/lecture by capturing more than two agents with a scalar value v (because the ghosts are all cooperating to defeat the Pacman).\n\n\n\\begin{algorithm} \\caption{Alpha-Beta Pruning} \\begin{algorithmic} \\Function{Max-Value}{$state, \\alpha, \\beta$} \\State $v \\gets -\\infty$ \\State $successors \\gets$ \\textsc{Expand}($state$) \\For{\\textbf{each} $s$ \\textbf{in} $successors$} \\State $v \\gets$ \\Call{Max}{$v$, \\textsc{Min-Value}($successor, \\alpha, \\beta$)} \\If{$v &gt; \\beta$} \\State \\textbf{return} $v$ \\EndIf \\State $\\alpha \\gets$ \\Call{Max}{$\\alpha, v$} \\EndFor \\State \\textbf{return} $v$ \\EndFunction \\State \\Function{Min-Value}{$state, \\alpha, \\beta$} \\State $v \\gets \\infty$ \\State $successors \\gets$ \\textsc{Expand}($state$) \\For{\\textbf{each} $s$ \\textbf{in} $successors$} \\State $v \\gets$ \\Call{Min}{$v$, \\textsc{Value}($successor, \\alpha, \\beta$)} \\If{$v &lt; \\alpha$} \\State \\textbf{return} $v$ \\EndIf \\State $\\beta \\gets$ \\Call{Min}{$\\beta, v$} \\EndFor \\State \\textbf{return} $v$ \\EndFunction \\State \\Function{Value}{$state, \\alpha, \\beta$} \\If{\\Call{NextAgent}{$state$} is $Max$} \\State \\textbf{return} \\Call{Max-Value}{$state, \\alpha, \\beta$} \\EndIf \\State \\textbf{return} \\Call{Min-Value}{$state, \\alpha, \\beta$} \\EndFunction \\end{algorithmic} \\end{algorithm}\n\n\nTo test and debug your code, run\npython autograder.py -q q3\nThis will show what your algorithm does on a number of small trees, as well as a pacman game. To run it without graphics, use:\npython autograder.py -q q3 --no-graphics\nThe correct implementation of alpha-beta pruning will lead to Pacman losing the game for some of the tests.

    "text": "6 Q4 (5 pts): Expectimax\nMinimax and alpha-beta are great, but they both assume that you are playing against an adversary who makes optimal decisions. As anyone who has ever won tic-tac-toe can tell you, this is not always the case. In this question you will implement the ExpectimaxAgent, which is useful for modeling probabilistic behavior of agents who may make suboptimal choices.\nAs with the search and problems yet to be covered in this class, the beauty of these algorithms is their general applicability. To expedite your own development, we’ve supplied some test cases based on generic trees. You can debug your implementation on small the game trees using the command:\npython autograder.py -q q4\nDebugging on these small and manageable test cases is recommended and will help you to find bugs quickly.\nOnce your algorithm is working on small trees, you can observe its success in Pacman. Random ghosts are of course not optimal minimax agents, and so modeling them with minimax search may not be appropriate. ExpectimaxAgent will no longer take the min over all ghost actions, but the expectation according to your agent’s model of how the ghosts act. To simplify your code, assume you will only be running against an adversary which chooses amongst their getLegalActions uniformly at random.\nTo see how the ExpectimaxAgent behaves in Pacman, run:\npython pacman.py -p ExpectimaxAgent -l minimaxClassic -a depth=3\nYou should now observe a more cavalier approach in close quarters with ghosts. In particular, if Pacman perceives that he could be trapped but might escape to grab a few more pieces of food, he’ll at least try. Investigate the results of these two scenarios:\npython pacman.py -p AlphaBetaAgent -l trappedClassic -a depth=3 -q -n 10\npython pacman.py -p ExpectimaxAgent -l trappedClassic -a depth=3 -q -n 10\nYou should find that your ExpectimaxAgent wins about half the time, while your AlphaBetaAgent always loses. Make sure you understand why the behavior here differs from the minimax case.\nThe correct implementation of expectimax will lead to Pacman losing some of the tests. This is not a problem: as it is correct behaviour, it will pass the tests."

    "text": "4 Q1 (3 pts): Depth First Search\n(3 pts) In searchAgents.py, you’ll find a fully implemented SearchAgent, which plans out a path through Pacman’s world and then executes that path step-by-step. The search algorithms for formulating a plan are not implemented – that’s your job.\nFirst, test that the SearchAgent is working correctly by running:\npython pacman.py -l tinyMaze -p SearchAgent -a fn=tinyMazeSearch\nThe command above tells the SearchAgent to use tinyMazeSearch as its search algorithm, which is implemented in search.py. Pacman should navigate the maze successfully.\nNow it’s time to write full-fledged generic search functions to help Pacman plan routes! Pseudocode for the search algorithms you’ll write can be found in the lecture slides. Remember that a search node must contain not only a state but also the information necessary to reconstruct the path (plan) which gets to that state.\nImportant note: All of your search functions need to return a list of actions that will lead the agent from the start to the goal. These actions all have to be legal moves (valid directions, no moving through walls).\nImportant note: Make sure to use the Stack, Queue and PriorityQueue data structures provided to you in util.py! These data structure implementations have particular properties which are required for compatibility with the autograder.\nHint: Each algorithm is very similar. Algorithms for DFS, BFS, UCS, and A* differ only in the details of how the fringe is managed. So, concentrate on getting DFS right and the rest should be relatively straightforward. Indeed, one possible implementation requires only a single generic search method which is configured with an algorithm-specific queuing strategy. (Your implementation need not be of this form to receive full credit).\nImplement the depth-first search (DFS) algorithm in the depthFirstSearch function in search.py. To make your algorithm complete, write the graph search version of DFS, which avoids expanding any already visited states.\nYour code should quickly find a solution for:\npython pacman.py -l tinyMaze -p SearchAgent\npython pacman.py -l mediumMaze -p SearchAgent\npython pacman.py -l bigMaze -z .5 -p SearchAgent\nThe Pacman board will show an overlay of the states explored, and the order in which they were explored (brighter red means earlier exploration). Is the exploration order what you would have expected? Does Pacman actually go to all the explored squares on his way to the goal?\nHint: If you use a Stack as your data structure, the solution found by your DFS algorithm for mediumMaze should have a length of 130 (provided you push successors onto the fringe in the order provided by getSuccessors; you might get 246 if you push them in the reverse order). Is this a least cost solution? If not, think about what depth-first search is doing wrong.\nGrading: Please run the below command to see if your implementation passes all the autograder test cases.\npython autograder.py -q q1"

Consider mediumDottedMaze and mediumScaryMaze.\nBy changing the cost function, we can encourage Pacman to find different paths. For example, we can charge more for dangerous steps in ghost-ridden areas or less for steps in food-rich areas, and a rational Pacman agent should adjust its behavior in response.\nImplement the uniform-cost graph search algorithm in the uniformCostSearch function in search.py. We encourage you to look through util.py for some data structures that may be useful in your implementation. You should now observe successful behavior in all three of the following layouts, where the agents below are all UCS agents that differ only in the cost function they use (the agents and cost functions are written for you):\npython pacman.py -l mediumMaze -p SearchAgent -a fn=ucs\npython pacman.py -l mediumDottedMaze -p StayEastSearchAgent\npython pacman.py -l mediumScaryMaze -p StayWestSearchAgent\nNote: You should get very low and very high path costs for the StayEastSearchAgent and StayWestSearchAgent respectively, due to their exponential cost functions (see searchAgents.py for details).\nGrading: Please run the below command to see if your implementation passes all the autograder test cases.\npython autograder.py -q q3"

Now, it’s time to formulate a new problem and design a heuristic for it.\nIn corner mazes, there are four dots, one in each corner. Our new search problem is to find the shortest path through the maze that touches all four corners (whether the maze actually has food there or not). Note that for some mazes like tinyCorners, the shortest path does not always go to the closest food first! Hint: the shortest path through tinyCorners takes 28 steps.\nNote: Make sure to complete Question 2 before working on Question 5, because Question 5 builds upon your answer for Question 2.\nImplement the CornersProblem search problem in searchAgents.py. You will need to choose a state representation that encodes all the information necessary to detect whether all four corners have been reached. Now, your search agent should solve:\npython pacman.py -l tinyCorners -p SearchAgent -a fn=bfs,prob=CornersProblem\npython pacman.py -l mediumCorners -p SearchAgent -a fn=bfs,prob=CornersProblem\nTo receive full credit, you need to define an abstract state representation that does not encode irrelevant information (like the position of ghosts, where extra food is, etc.). In particular, do not use a Pacman GameState as a search state. Your code will be very, very slow if you do (and also wrong).\nAn instance of the CornersProblem class represents an entire search problem, not a particular state. Particular states are returned by the functions you write, and your functions return a data structure of your choosing (e.g. tuple, set, etc.) that represents a state.\nFurthermore, while a program is running, remember that many states simultaneously exist, all on the queue of the search algorithm, and they should be independent of each other. In other words, you should not have only one state for the entire CornersProblem object; your class should be able to generate many different states to provide to the search algorithm.\nHint 1: The only parts of the game state you need to reference in your implementation are the starting Pacman position and the location of the four corners.\nHint 2: When coding up getSuccessors, make sure to add children to your successors list with a cost of 1.\nOur implementation of breadthFirstSearch expands just under 2000 search nodes on mediumCorners.

More effective heuristics will return values closer to the actual goal costs. To be admissible, the heuristic values must be lower bounds on the actual shortest path cost to the nearest goal (and non-negative). To be consistent, it must additionally hold that if an action has cost c, then taking that action can only cause a drop in heuristic of at most c.\nRemember that admissibility isn’t enough to guarantee correctness in graph search – you need the stronger condition of consistency. However, admissible heuristics are usually also consistent, especially if they are derived from problem relaxations. Therefore it is usually easiest to start out by brainstorming admissible heuristics. Once you have an admissible heuristic that works well, you can check whether it is indeed consistent, too. The only way to guarantee consistency is with a proof. However, inconsistency can often be detected by verifying that for each node you expand, its successor nodes are equal or higher in in f-value. Moreover, if UCS and A* ever return paths of different lengths, your heuristic is inconsistent. This stuff is tricky!\nNon-Trivial Heuristics: The trivial heuristics are the ones that return zero everywhere (UCS) and the heuristic which computes the true completion cost. The former won’t save you any time, while the latter will timeout the autograder. You want a heuristic which reduces total compute time, though for this assignment the autograder will only check node counts (aside from enforcing a reasonable time limit).\nGrading: Your heuristic must be a non-trivial non-negative consistent heuristic to receive any points. Make sure that your heuristic returns 0 at every goal state and never returns a negative value.

    "text": "10 Q7 (4 pts): Eating All The Dots\nNow we’ll solve a hard search problem: eating all the Pacman food in as few steps as possible. For this, we’ll need a new search problem definition which formalizes the food-clearing problem: FoodSearchProblem in searchAgents.py (implemented for you). A solution is defined to be a path that collects all of the food in the Pacman world. For the present project, solutions do not take into account any ghosts or power pellets; solutions only depend on the placement of walls, regular food and Pacman. (Of course ghosts can ruin the execution of a solution! We’ll get to that in the next project.) If you have written your general search methods correctly, A* with a null heuristic (equivalent to uniform-cost search) should quickly find an optimal solution to testSearch with no code change on your part (total cost of 7).\npython pacman.py -l testSearch -p AStarFoodSearchAgent\nNote: AStarFoodSearchAgent is a shortcut for\n-p SearchAgent -a fn=astar,prob=FoodSearchProblem,heuristic=foodHeuristic\nYou should find that UCS starts to slow down even for the seemingly simple tinySearch.

I completed a B.S. (with honors) in Physics at the College of William and Mary in 2009.\nI am interested in improving the decisions that humans make. What that means is determined by each human.\nAdjacent to the university, I make acoustic, electric, and electronic music."

    "text": "The Expr Class\nIn the first part of this project, you will be working with the Expr class defined in logic.py to build propositional logic sentences. An Expr object is implemented as a tree with logical operators (\\land, \\lor, \\neg, \\Rightarrow, \\iff) at each node and with literals (A, B, C) at the leaves. Here is an example sentence and its representation:\n(A \\land B) \\iff (\\neg C \\lor D)\n\n\n\n\nExample logic tree.\n\n\n\nTo instantiate a symbol named ‘A’, call the constructor like this:\nA = Expr('A')\nThe Expr class allows you to use Python operators to build up these expressions. The following are the available Python operators and their meanings:\n\n~A: \\neg A\nA & B: A \\land B\nA | B: A \\lor B\nA &gt;&gt; B: A \\Rightarrow B\nA % B: A \\iff B\n\nSo to build the expression A \\land B, you would type this:\nA = Expr('A')\n\nB = Expr('B')\n\na_and_b = A & B\n(Note that A to the left of the assignment operator in that example is just a Python variable name, i.e. symbol1 = Expr('A') would have worked just as well.)\n\nA note on conjoin and disjoin\nOne last important thing to note is that you must use conjoin and disjoin operators wherever possible. conjoin creates a chained & (logical AND) expression, and disjoin creates a chained | (logical OR) expression. Let’s say you wanted to check whether conditions A, B, C, D, and E are all true. The naive way to achieve this is writing condition = A & B & C & D & E, but this actually translates to ((((A & B) & C) & D) & E), which creates a very nested logic tree (see (1) in diagram below) and becomes a nightmare to debug. Instead, conjoin makes a flat tree (see (2) in diagram below).\n\n\n\n\nConoin/Disjoin Examples"

    "text": "Prop Symbol Names (Important!)\nFor the rest of the project, please use the following variable naming conventions:\n\nRules\n\nWhen we introduce variables, they must start with an upper-case character (including Expr).\nOnly these characters should appear in variable names: A-Z, a-z, 0-9, _, ^, [, ].\nLogical connective characters (&, |) must not appear in variable names. So, Expr('A & B') is illegal because it attempts to create a single constant symbol named 'A & B'. We would use Expr('A') & Expr('B') to make a logical expression.\n\n\n\nPacphysics symbols\n\nPropSymbolExpr(pacman_str, x, y, time=t): whether or not Pacman is at (x, y) at time t, writes P[x,y]_t.\nPropSymbolExpr(wall_str, x, y): whether or not a wall is at (x, y), writes WALL[x,y].\nPropSymbolExpr(action, time=t): whether or not pacman takes action action at time t, where action is an element of DIRECTIONS, writes i.e. North_t.\nIn general, PropSymbolExpr(str, a1, a2, a3, a4, time=a5) creates the expression str[a1,a2,a3,a4]_a5 where str is just a string.\n\nThere is additional, more detailed documentation for the Expr class in logic.py.\n\n\nSAT Solver Setup\nA SAT (satisfiability) solver takes a logic expression which encodes the rules of the world and returns a model (true and false assignments to logic symbols) that satisfies that expression if such a model exists. To efficiently find a possible model from an expression, we take advantage of the pycosat module, which is a Python wrapper around the picoSAT library.\nYou can install using\npip install pycosat\nIf your Python executable is python3, you may need\npip3 install pycosat\nIf you use conda:\nconda install pycosat\nIf you use mamba, poetry, rye, uv, etc., use the syntax for your package manager.\nAfter unzipping the project code and changing to the project code directory, run:\npython pycosat_test.py\nThis should output:\n[1, -2, -3, -4, 5]\nPlease let me know if you have issues with this setup.

Do not do any logical simplification, just put them in a list in this order, and return the list conjoined. Each element of your list should correspond to each of the three sentences.\n\nA \\lor B\n\\neg A \\iff (\\neg B \\lor C)\n\\neg A \\lor \\neg B \\lor C\n\nsentence2(): Create one Expr instance that represents the proposition that the following four sentences are true.

Hint: recall that PropSymbolExpr(str, a1, a2, a3, a4, time=a5) creates the expression str[a1,a2,a3,a4]_a5 where str is a string; you should make some strings for this problem. Then, create one Expr instance which encodes the following three English sentences as propositional logic in this order without any simplification:\n\n\nPacman is alive at time 1 if and only if he was alive at time 0 and he was not killed at time 0 or he was not alive at time 0 and he was born at time 0.\nAt time 0, Pacman cannot both be alive and be born.\nPacman is born at time 0.\n\n\nfindModelCheck():\n\n\nLook at how the findModel(sentence) method works: it uses to_cnf to convert the input sentence into Conjunctive Normal Form (the form required by the SAT solver), and passes it to the SAT solver to find a satisfying assignment to the symbols in sentence, i.e., a model. A model is a dictionary of the symbols in your expression and a corresponding assignment of True or False. Test your sentence1(), sentence2(), and sentence3() with findModel by opening an interactive session in Python and running from logicPlan import * and findModel(sentence1()) and similar queries for the other two. Do they match what you thought?\nBased on the above, fill in findModelCheck so that it returns something that looks the exact same as findModel(Expr('a')) in a Python interactive session would if lower-cased letters were allowed. You should not use findModel or Expr, simply directly recreate the output. For instance, if the output was [(MyVariable, True)], something close to the solution would be return [(\"MyVariable\", True)].\n\n\nentails(premise, conclusion): Return True if and only if the premise entails the conclusion. Hint: findModel is helpful here; think about what must be unsatisfiable in order for the entails to be True, and what it means for something to be unstatisfiable.\nplTrueInverse(assignments, inverse_statement): Returns True if and only if the (not inverse_statement) is True given assignments.\n\nBefore you continue, try instantiating a small sentence, e.g. A \\land B \\Rightarrow C, and call to_cnf on it. Inspect the output and make sure you understand it (refer to Russell & Norvig, Section 7.5.2, for details on the algorithm to_cnf implements).\nTo test and debug your code run:\npython autograder.py -q q1"

Each input expression will be a literal.

An additional requirement is that the returned Expr must be in CNF (conjunctive normal form). You may NOT use the to_cnf function in your method implementations (or any of the helper functions logic.eliminate_implications, logic.move_not_inwards, and logic.distribute_and_over_or).\nDon’t run to_cnf on your knowledge base when implementing your planning agents in later questions. This is because to_cnf makes your logical expression much longer sometimes, so you want to minimize this effect, and findModel does this already. In later questions, reuse your implementations for atLeastOne(.), atMostOne(.), and exactlyOne(.) instead of re-engineering these functions (to avoid accidentally making an unreasonably slow non-CNF-based implementation) from scratch.\nYou may utilize the logic.pl_true function to test the output of your expressions. pl_true takes an expression and a model and returns True if and only if the expression is true given the model.\nTo test and debug your code run:\npython autograder.py -q q2"

Implement the following method using propositional logic to plan Pacman’s sequence of actions leading him to the goal:\nDisclaimer: the methods from now on will be decently slow. This is because a SAT solver is very general and simply crunches logic, unlike our previous algorithms that employ a specific human-created algorithm to specific type of problem. Of note, Pycosat’s main algorithm is in C, which is generally a much much faster language to execute than Python, and it’s still this slow.\n\npositionLogicPlan(problem): Given an instance of logicPlan.PlanningProblem, returns a sequence of action strings for the Pacman agent to execute.\n\nYou will not be implementing a search algorithm, but creating expressions that represent pacphysics for all possible positions at each time step. This means that at each time step, you should be adding general rules for all possible locations on the grid, where the rules do not assume anything about Pacman’s current position.\nYou will need to code up the following sentences for your knowledge base, in the following pseudocode form:\n\nAdd to KB: Initial knowledge: Pacman’s initial location at timestep 0\nfor t in range(50). (Autograder will not test on layouts requiring \\geq 50 timesteps.)\nPrint time step; this is to see that the code is running and how far it is.\nAdd to KB: Initial knowledge: Pacman can only be at exactlyOne of the locations in non_wall_coords at timestep t. This is similar to pacphysicsAxioms, but don’t use that method since we are using non_wall_coors when generating the list of possible locations in the first place (and walls_grid later).\nIs there a satisfying assignment for the variables given the knowledge base so far? Use findModel and pass in the Goal Assertion and KB.\nIf there is, return a sequence of actions from start to goal using extractActionSequence.\nHere, Goal Assertion is the expression asserting that Pacman is at the goal at timestep t.\nAdd to KB: Pacman takes exactly one action per timestep.\nAdd to KB: Transition Model sentences: call pacmanSuccessorAxiomSingle(...) for all possible pacman positions in non_wall_coords.\n\nTest your code on smaller mazes using:\npython pacman.py -l maze2x2 -p LogicAgent -a fn=plp\npython pacman.py -l tinyMaze -p LogicAgent -a fn=plp\nTo test and debug your code run:\npython autograder.py -q q4\nNote that with the way we have Pacman’s grid laid out, the leftmost, bottommost space occupiable by Pacman (assuming there isn’t a wall there) is (1, 1), as shown below (not (0, 0)).\n\n\n\nSummary of Pacphysics used in Q3 and Q4:\n\nFor all x, y, t: if there is a wall at (x, y), then pacman is not at (x, y) at t.\nFor each t: Pacman is at exactly on of the locations described by all possible (x, y). Can be optimized with knowledge of outer or all walls, follow spec for each function.\nFor each t: Pacman takes exactly on of the possible actions.\nFor each t (except for t = ??): Transition model: Pacman is at (x, y) at t if and only if he was at (join with or: (x - dx, y - dy) at t-1 and took action (dx, dy) at t-1).\n\nNote that the above always hold true regardless of any specific game, actions, etc. To the above always-true/ axiom rules, we add information consistent with what we know.\nDebugging hints:\n\nIf you’re finding a length-0 or a length-1 solution: is it enough to simply have axioms for where Pacman is at a given time? What’s to prevent him from also being in other places?\nAs a sanity check, verify that if Pacman is at (1, 1) at time 0 and at (4, 4) at time 6, he was never at (5, 5) at any time in between.\nIf your solution is taking more than a couple minutes to finish running, you may want to revisit implementation of exactlyOne and atMostOne, and ensure that you’re using as few clauses as possible."

    "section": "Question 6 (4 points): Localization",
    "text": "Question 6 (4 points): Localization\nThe Pacman starts with a known map, but unknown starting location. It has a 4-bit sensor that returns whether there is a wall in its NSEW directions. (For example, 1001 means there is a wall to pacman’s North and West directions, and these 4-bits are represented using a list with 4 booleans.) By keeping track of these sensor readings and the action it took at each timestep, Pacman is able to pinpoint its location. You will code up the sentences that help Pacman determine the possible locations it can be at each timestep by implementing:\n\nlocalization(problem, agent): Given an instance of logicPlan.LocalizationProblem and an instance of logicAgents.LocalizationLogicAgent, repeatedly yields for timesteps t between 0 and agent.num_steps-1 a list of possible locations (x_i, y_i) at t: [(x_0_0, y_0_0), (x_1_0, y_1_0), …]. Note that you don’t need to worry about how generators work as that line is already written for you.\n\nFor Pacman to make use of sensor information during localization, you will use two methods already implemented for you: sensorAxioms – i.e. \nBlocked[Direction]_t \\iff [(P[x_i, y_j]_t \\land WALL[x_i+dx, y_j+dy]) \\lor (P[x_i’, y_j’]_t \\land WALL[x_i’+dx, y_j’+dy]) … ]\n– and fourBitPerceptRules, which translate the percepts at time t into logic sentences.\nPlease implement the function according to our pseudocode:\n\nAdd to KB: where the walls are (walls_list) and aren’t (not in walls_list).\nfor t in range(agent.num_timesteps):\nAdd pacphysics, action, and percept information to KB.\nFind possible pacman locations with updated KB.\nCall agent.moveToNextState(action_t) on the current agent action at timestep t.\nyield the possible locations.\n\nNote on display: the yellow Pacman is where he is at the time that’s currently being calculated, so possible locations and known walls and free spaces are from the previous timestep.\nTo test and debug your code run:\npython autograder.py -q q6"

    "section": "Question 8 (4 points): SLAM",
    "text": "Question 8 (4 points): SLAM\nSometimes Pacman is just really lost and in the dark at the same time. In SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping), Pacman knows his initial coordinates, but does not know where the walls are. In SLAM, Pacman may inadvertently take illegal actions (for example, going North when there is a wall blocking that action), which will add to the uncertainty of Pacman’s location over time. Additionally, in our setup of SLAM, Pacman no longer has a 4 bit sensor that tells us whether there is a wall in the four directions, but only has a 3-bit sensor that reveals the number of walls he is adjacent to. (This is sort of like wifi signal-strength bars; 000 = not adjacent to any wall; 100 = adjacent to exactly 1 wall; 110 = adjacent to exactly 2 walls; 111 = adjacent to exactly 3 walls. These 3 bits are represented by a list of 3 booleans.) Thus, instead of using sensorAxioms and fourBitPerceptRules, you will use SLAMSensorAxioms and numAdjWallsPerceptRules. You will code up the sentences that help Pacman determine (1) his possible locations at each timestep, and (2) the location of the walls, by implementing:\n\nslam(problem, agent): Given an instance of logicPlan.SLAMProblem and logicAgents.SLAMLogicAgent, repeatedly yields a tuple of two items:\n\nknown_map at t (of the same format as in question 6 (mapping))\nlist of possible pacman locations at t (of the same format as in question 5 (localization))\n\n\nTo pass the autograder, please implement the function according to our pseudocode:\n\nGet initial location (pac_x_0, pac_y_0) of Pacman, and add this to KB.
